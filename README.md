**Telecom-Customer-Churn-Project**
<h1>Welcome to my Telecom Churn Analysis Project!</h1>

<h2>📊 Exploring Customer Churn in the Telecom Industry:</h2>

- <b>Gender Analysis:</b> Does gender influence customer retention, and if so, what patterns emerge?
- <b>Customer Switching:</b> What percentage of customers switch to other providers?
- <b>Contract Types:</b> How do different contract types impact customer retention?
- <b>Payment Methods:</b> What is the relationship between payment methods and customer churn?
- <b>Partner Presence:</b> How does the presence or absence of a partner affect churn?
- <b>Internet Service Types:</b> Which type of internet service leads to more churn?

<h2>🔍 Project Phases:</h2>

- <b>Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA):</b> Explore the dataset and identify key insights.
- <b>Data Visualization:</b> Visualize the data to better understand trends and patterns.
- <b>Machine Learning:</b> Utilize decision tree classifier and random forest classifier to predict future customer churn.

<h2>🛠️ Data Preprocessing Steps:</h2>

- Separate the dataset into two DataFrames:
  - <b>feats:</b> Containing the explanatory variables.
  - <b>target:</b> Containing the target variable Churn.
- Train a model on one subset of the data that learns patterns from the independent features.
- Making Predictions: Leverage the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data.

<p>Follow along as I delve into these questions and explore the steps leading up to predictive churn analysis.</p>
